Notes
-----
I started this app as 'JollaWeather', but when uploading it to the Jolla Harbour
I recognized that the 'app binary guideline' prohibits to use names starting
with 'Jolla'. Probably because Jolla reserves this name for their own apps. So
I renamed the app JWeather, but this repo is still using the original name.
